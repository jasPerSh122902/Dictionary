# Dictionary
This data structure is meant to take a key workds and give a definition. This data stuctor uses a array to store the data and you can not remove things that are in the mibble of that array. You can only remove things form the top.

# opening
When opening the .exe file for the Dictionary you will get a panel that will give you lines and values.

# First start
I added a lot of values to the array and made the  find value funtion to find the value

# First change
Then I made the find key function find a key and spit it out to the console
# second change
I then searched for key 2 and make it give you the key and the value.

# third change
Then I tried to remove the 2 key. Its going to show four things you are going to get a key, value, value and key, then the key again, and item removed. This is because I have to run a few checks to see if the key exists then git its value then git the whole thing then get the key one more time tho then remove the value.

# fourth change
I tried to earch for keys 2 value which was deleted. and as such it will show blank.
